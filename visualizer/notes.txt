Data format
-------------------
Changed tiles (within vision range) as json array of
    row col newtype



visualizer issues:
    zoom on center
    drag
    element dependencies / redrawing
        layers

use keyframes

fog:
can precompute mask for view radius (array of rows (giving length and optionally -offset), or boolean quarter circle using symmetric update (could extend to eighth and special case diagonals))
    umm, this is just the problem of making a circle, surely been studied
no need to reset layer for new viewpoints, only removing
could also do partial removing, clearing the vision of removed tiles and only readding viewpoints within 2*viewradius
    could keep count of observers and decrement; probably not worth it?
    how to get the area to clear? could use the add-tile method
also, vision could be chunkier; likely not as good
may want to only do view updates for edge tiles in case of large blocks
    could in general only do circle portions in direction where there isn't another view tile; pretty near optimal
        can just check the map if already updated
        can be used to re-add distant tiles when removing, but either only those with r < d < 2r or don't count non-selected (farther) tiles for adjacency check
could track whole chunks of tiles (wouldn't be as applicable if nano propagates incrementally)

optional feature: could have darker fog for never-been-seen

does some layers library do partial redraw (e.g. for non-active-player terrain changes under fog)?
    kinetic js would in all likelyhood if the tiles were a group of objects...
    *! unnecessary, since using layers it's only a single image draw anyway
        but this just moves the partial draw question to the fog layer/canvas for fog updates
